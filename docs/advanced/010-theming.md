# Theming
QuizWitz can be themed with Adobe Animate. You can download a [theme template](https://themes.quizwitz.com/empty/quizwitz-empty-theme.zip) 
that you can then use a starting point. Note that theming QuizWitz is a painstaking process and is best left to designers 
who know the ins and out of Adobe Animate.

Rather leave it to the professionals? Send us an email at [support@catlab.be](mailto:support@catlab.be) and we will 
make you an estimate of the cost to turn your design into a QuizWitz theme.

## Theme test tool
When you are ready to test your themes you zip your design and upload it to our [theme tester](https://themes.quizwitz.com/). 
Make sure to zip the content of the folder and not the folder itself (so when you open the zip you should not see a 
single folder but instead a list of files) and upload it to get a preview.

Once you have tested your design you can email the zip to us and we will attach it to your account so that you can use 
the theme in your quizzes.

## QuizWitz Logo
We do request that all designs include the QuizWitz logo.
