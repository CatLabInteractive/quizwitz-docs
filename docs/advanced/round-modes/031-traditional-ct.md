# 🧩 Traditional – Common Thread

A **Traditional – Common Thread** round works just like a [traditional round](030-traditional.md), but with a twist:  
At the end of the round, the **last question** (“What was the common thread?”) is evaluated and shown first. This lets the quizmaster highlight the connection before revealing the other answers.

## 📝 How it works

- Players can change their answers for all questions until the round ends.
- At the end, the last question (the common thread) is revealed and explained first.
- All other question feedback is shown afterwards, so the quizmaster can elaborate on the connection.
