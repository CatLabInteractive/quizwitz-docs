# Multiquestion
Players select one of multiple possible questions for various amounts of points.

## Editor
Individual questions are grouped in 'Question groups'. For each question group, players will be able to select a single 
question to answer. 

Make sure to set the 'Label' attribute for each individual question so that the players know 
what they choose. This can be cryptic ('animals', 'sports', 'history) or descriptive ('easy multiple choice', 'hard multiple 
choice', 'open question'), or any other way you can imagine this round to work.

## Good to know
- Even though you can set the duration multiplier for each individual question, the game will use the highest value 
  for all questions in the group.
- Visible attachments 'during' questions will not be displayed. Audio can be used.
- Before question attachments of all questions in each group will be combined in a single view.
