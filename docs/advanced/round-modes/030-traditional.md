# Traditional
A traditional quiz round where players can change their answer until the end of the round. This round mode simulates
the pub quiz tradition of handing in your answer sheet at the end of each round.

Traditional rounds may contain open questions and multiple choice questions. When each question is asked, a new 
answer field appears on the device of the player.

All answers are automatically submitted when the timer of the last question runs out.

As answers can be edited until the end of the round, it is not possible to use the 'Stop timer when everyone answered' 
question option in combination with traditional rounds.
