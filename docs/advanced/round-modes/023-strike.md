# ⚡ Strike

In a **Strike** round, players can climb through multiple levels by answering consecutive questions correctly. The higher their streak, the more points they can earn!

---

## 📝 How it works

- Players start at level 1.
- Each time a player answers correctly, they advance to the next level.
- Every level increases the points they can earn on the next question.
- If a player gets a question wrong, they drop down a configurable number of levels (not necessarily all the way to the start).
- By default, there are **5 levels** and each level grants **20% extra points** (e.g. 100% → 120% → 140%...), but both the number of levels, the extra percentage per level, and the drop amount for wrong answers are configurable in the round settings.

## ⚙️ Settings

- **Number of levels:** Set how many levels a player can climb (default is 5).
- **Point increase per level:** Set how much each level increases the next question’s points (default is 20% per level).
- **Levels lost on wrong answer:** Configure how many levels a player drops if they answer incorrectly.

## 💡 Tips

- **Reward consistency!** The longer a player keeps answering correctly, the more their score multiplies.
- Use for fast-paced or competitive rounds to add excitement and risk.
- Mix easy and challenging questions to shake up the streaks.
