# 🙋‍♂️ Player introduction

**Player introduction** is a special event that simply displays the **names and selected emojis of all players or teams** on the main game screen.

## 📝 How it works

- At this point in the quiz, each participant’s **name** and chosen **emoji** will appear on the big screen.
- This is often used at the start of an event, after a break, or before a final round to introduce or celebrate participants.
