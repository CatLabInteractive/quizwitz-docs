# 🏢 Department elimination

**Department elimination** is a special event that removes players from a specific department, using the same elimination criteria as the standard [Elimination](050-elimination.md) round.

---

## 📝 How it works

- When this event is triggered, only players or teams belonging to the selected department are considered for elimination.
- The elimination criteria are flexible:
    - **Kick the lowest ranked in the department** until a set number of players remain
    - **Kick the highest ranked in the department** until a set number remain
    - **Kick a specific number of lowest ranked** in the department
    - **Kick a specific number of highest ranked** in the department
- The number of players to keep or eliminate can be set as an exact number or percentage.

> Department elimination lets you run knockouts within a group or department, perfect for tournaments or themed competitions.
