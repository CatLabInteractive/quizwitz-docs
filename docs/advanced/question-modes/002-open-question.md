# Open question

An open question lets players type their answer freely using their keyboard. This mode is perfect for questions where you want written responses ‚Äî for example, names, numbers, or short explanations.

## üìù How it works

- **Question:** Ask for a specific answer in a freeform text field (example: ‚ÄúWhich duo performs this song?‚Äù).
- **Answer:** Players type in their response. You can provide multiple accepted answers for automatic validation.
- **Attachments:** Add audio, images, or video as a clue (for example, play a music clip).
- **Feedback:** Players see after answering if their response was marked correct or not. You can also provide additional feedback or explanations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Expanded settings

Open questions offer a range of settings to fit your quiz:

- **Multiple accepted answers:** Add alternate spellings, abbreviations, or synonyms for more flexible auto-correction.
- **Time-based scoring:** Reward faster answers (see ‚ÄúScoring‚Äù below).
- **Force automatic correction:** Enable this to let the game automatically mark correct answers based on your provided list.
    - If not enabled (the default for most live games), open answers must be reviewed and scored manually using the [Jury app](../../quizmaster/004-jury-app.md).

For more on these options, see [writing questions](../../editor/005-writing-questions.md).

## üèÜ Scoring for open questions

Scoring in open questions is designed to be fair, even for slower typers:

- **Time-based scoring** divides the available points into blocks, not a strict per-millisecond countdown.
- For example, answering in the first block (e.g. first 5 seconds) gives full points; the next block gives 80%, and so on. This helps reduce the penalty for slow typers.
- By default, only **25%** of the points depend on speed ‚Äî the remaining **75%** is fixed, so everyone who answers correctly gets most of the points, regardless of typing speed.

> ‚öôÔ∏è **Tip:** You can further adjust scoring behavior and other settings in the [Round options](../../editor/008-round-options.md).

## üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Jury review in QuizWitz Live

In **QuizWitz Live**, open questions generally require a manual review with the [Jury app](../../quizmaster/004-jury-app.md):

- The Jury app lets jury members accept, reject, or adjust scoring for open answers.
- Phonetic and alternative matching helps, but human judgment is essential for fair scoring and creativity.
- For full instructions and features, see the [Jury app documentation](../../quizmaster/004-jury-app.md).
