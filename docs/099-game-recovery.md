# ⚠️ Live Crash Recovery

Did your game freeze? Did the tab close by accident? [**QuizWitz Live**](../introduction) includes a built-in recovery system to help you get back on track — without losing your progress.

## 🔄 How game recovery works

If your game crashes, hangs, or is interrupted for any reason — whether it’s a browser issue, system restart, or accidental tab closure — you can resume the session easily.

Just **reopen the same browser tab or game screen** you were using to display the **main game view**. This is the screen you project or stream to your audience.

When it loads:

- You’ll be prompted to **resume the previous session** or **start a new one**
- If you choose to resume, the game will restore your progress as closely as possible

---

### ▶️ Resuming the game

Select **“Resume game”** to:

- Continue from the same question or round
- Restore the quiz state and visuals

> ✅ This is the best option if your game crashed, froze, or was accidentally closed.

---

### 🆕 Starting a new game

You can also choose to **start a new game** instead.

- This will completely **clear the previous session**
- You’ll return to the beginning of the quiz setup

> ⚠️ Only choose this if you’re certain you don’t want to continue the existing game.

## 💡 Good to know

- Recovery only works if you **return to the same game screen in the same browser**
- Do **not** navigate to a different page — reopen the **exact URL** you were using to host the game
- This feature helps recover from:
  - Browser crashes
  - Freezing or hanging mid-quiz
  - Accidental closure or refresh

---

With game recovery, you can host confidently — knowing that even if something goes wrong, you can pick up right where you left off.
