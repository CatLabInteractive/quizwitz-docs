# 🗺️ Image map

In an **Image map** question, players must select the correct spot (or spots) on an image displayed on their device. This is ideal for visual identification challenges, such as "Select the Erlenmeyer flask."

## 📝 How it works

- **Question:** Clearly state what players need to find on the image.  
  *(Example: “Select the Erlenmeyer flask.”)*
- **Image:** Upload a high-quality image that will be shown to all players.
- **Answer points:** Define one or more **target areas** (“points”) on the image. Each area can be set as a circle or another shape, and you determine its position and size.
- **Selecting answers:** Players tap or click to mark their answer(s) on the image.
    - If the answer falls **within a correct area**, they receive full points.
    - If the answer falls **outside the correct area** but within the “almost correct” radius, they can earn partial points based on the distance (as defined by the *score easing* setting).
- **Multiple answers:** If the question requires more than one answer, players must select each correct area.
    - Selecting the same area multiple times will **not** grant extra points.
- **Scoring method:** You can configure whether points are awarded for each correct area individually, or only when the required minimum number of correct answers are selected.

## ⚙️ Expanded settings

- **Number of answers:** Set the required minimum and maximum number of points a player must identify.
- **Score easing:** Adjusts partial credit for “almost correct” answers, based on how close the selection is to the correct area (only applies to distance between correct and almost correct).
- **Points per area:** Decide if points are awarded per correctly identified area, or only if all minimum required areas are selected.
- **Attachment options:** Add images, audio, or video for richer context. Set attributions if publishing.

See [writing questions](../editor/005-writing-questions.md) for general question settings.

## ⏱️ Time-based scoring

**Time-based scoring is enabled by default.** Players who answer quickly earn more points, but there’s always a fixed component (default: 75%) for a correct answer. Only 25% of the total score is influenced by how fast you answer.  
You can turn off time-based scoring for this question type if you wish.

📘 For details on scoring and time settings, see the [round options documentation](../editor/008-round-options.md#scoring).

## 💡 Tips for great image map questions

- **Use clear, non-cluttered images** for easy identification.
- **Define answer areas carefully** to avoid overlap or confusion.
- **Provide constructive feedback** to help players learn from mistakes.
- **Partial credit:** Use the “almost correct” option to reward near-misses and keep things fair.
