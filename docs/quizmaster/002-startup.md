## 🔐 Connecting with the Master Code

Once launched, your screen will display a **Master Code**. **Do not share this code with players** — it's used to connect your presentation device to the game.

- Visit [quizwitz.tv](https://quizwitz.tv) on your quizmaster device and enter the Master Code.
- A **Quizmaster App interface** will appear, where you control the game.
- We recommend a **tablet or smartphone** for mobility, but a laptop works too.

After connecting, the Master Code disappears from the screen. You're now ready to show the main screen on a projector or start your livestream.

> ⚠️ **Heads up!** If the game screen (main display) is not actively in focus — for example, if you switch tabs or minimize it — the game will **automatically pause**.  
> When this happens:
> - The **Quizmaster App also pauses**
> - To resume, first make sure the **game screen is active again**
> - Then **hover over the screen** to reveal the bottom menu and press the **pause button** to continue

## 🎮 Selecting your game mode

Once connected, choose between two game modes:

![Quizmaster app - select mode](/images/quizmaster-app-select-mode.png)

### Team codes

- Each team gets a **unique code**, which can be opened on multiple devices.
- Best for **pre-registered team quizzes** where you know the team names in advance.
- Allows device switching — helpful if a battery dies mid-quiz.

### Single game code

- Everyone joins using **one shared Game Code**.
- Ideal for casual or open-access events.
- No pre-registration required — players can join anytime, until all active seats are filled.

> Make sure you're logged in to access your quiz content.

## 👥 Hosting with Team codes

When using **Team codes**, you will first create teams in the Quizmaster App:

- Add team names
- Press **‘Generate Codes’** to create access codes  
  ![Quizmaster app - create teams](/images/quizmaster-app-create-teams.png)

You can also **reserve codes in advance** — more on that in the tips & tricks section.

Be sure to **save the following codes**:

- **Master Code** — to control the quiz
- **Jury Code** — for manual score adjustments
- **Regie Code** — to control visual and technical elements

Send team codes to your players via email or printouts.

When ready, click **‘Load quiz’**, wait for assets to load, and then click **‘Start’** to begin.
