# 🎟️ QuizWitz PRO – How seats work

QuizWitz PRO games require **active seats** to connect players. Seats are a flexible, pay-as-you-go or license-based system that scales with your needs — perfect for pub quizzes, livestreams, and professional quiz events.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 What are seats?

- Each connected **player or team** in a PRO game requires **1 active seat**.
- You can host games with **individual players** or **teams sharing one device** — each counts as one seat.
- **Regular (non-PRO) games** do **not** require seats and are ideal for casual play with friends or family.

---

## 🎮 Free seats for everyone

- Every account includes **3 free seats per game**, available to **all users**, even without a PRO license.
- These seats let you host small quizzes with friends or test your content at no cost.
- The 3 free seats **do not count toward your pay-as-you-go or license-based total**.

## 💼 QuizWitz PRO licenses

If you host quizzes regularly, a **QuizWitz PRO license** gives you **permanently active seats** that are always available — no need to activate them manually.

Available license tiers include:

- **PRO-50**: 50 permanently active seats
- **PRO-100**: 100 permanently active seats
- **PRO-500**: 500 permanently active seats
- **PRO-1K**: 1000 permanently active seats
- **PRO-2K**: 2000 permanently active seats

These seats are ideal for recurring events, larger team setups, or professional venues.

> ⚠️ **Important**: If you need to host a quiz with **more players than your license allows**, you must **activate pay-as-you-go seats** for the full number of players. The seats from your license are not added to your activated seats — they are **replaced** entirely.

---

## 💳 Pay-as-you-go & credits

For one-time or occasional events, you can activate **pay-as-you-go seats** instead of purchasing a license. This gives you flexibility without a long-term commitment.

- Seats are activated using **QuizWitz credits**, which you can buy in advance.
- **Volume discounts** are available when buying credits in bulk.
- Each **premium license** includes a **value of free credits**.
- If you're unsure how many players will join:
    - You can **wait until everyone connects** before activating seats.
    - Or, activate more seats than needed — **unused seats are automatically refunded** in credits after they expire.

---

## ⏳ Seat duration (pay-as-you-go)

- **Pay-as-you-go seats** stay active for **48 hours** after activation.
- Within that time, you can:
    - Run **multiple quizzes or sessions**
    - **Test** your quiz with larger groups
    - Host **multi-day events** over a weekend

---

## 📉 Pricing for large groups

- Seat prices **decrease** for larger player counts, making big events more affordable.

---

## ⚠️ Special case: whitelabel mode

- Games in **whitelabel mode** require **2 seats per player** instead of one.

> Example: A 100-player whitelabel game requires 200 seats.

QuizWitz PRO gives you flexible and professional tools to run events of any size — whether you activate seats on demand or rely on a PRO license for always-on access.
