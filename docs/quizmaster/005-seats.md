# Seats

All QuizWitz PRO games require one active seat for each connected player.

 * Seats are only required for PRO games. These game modes are designed for pub-quizzes and professional (livestream) quiz-events and offer additional tools to control the game. The regular game is more suited for friends- and family use and do not require active seats.
 * Your licenses include games with up to 3 players. These 3 seats are NOT added to your active total, so activate the amount of seats you actually need if it is higher than what your license allows.
 * Larger games require one active seat for each competing player. This can either be an individual player or a team of players sharing one answer device.
 * Activated seats stay active for 48 hours. You can host as many quizzes as you want as long as the seats stay active. This allows you to test the software with a larger group or organise multiple events in the same weekend.
 * Pay-as-you-go seats must be activated with QuizWitz credits that can be purchased in advance. We may offer a volume discount on these credits to lower the cost for frequent users.
 * Each purchased PREMIUM license comes with its own value in free credits.
 * For Single-Code games where you don't know how much people will join, you may want to wait until all players have connected before activating the seats. Alternatively, you can activate more seats than required. Unused seats will be refunded (in credits) once they have expired.
 * In order to keep very large games affordable, seat prices drop for larger groups.
 * Playing quizzes in 'Whitelabel-mode' requires two seats for each player.
