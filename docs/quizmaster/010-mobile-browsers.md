QuizWitz has been optimized to run on computers. While it may be possible to host QuizWitz Live or Conference games 
on tablets or smartphones, we do not recommend using Android or iOS based devices to run the game.

If you have no other choice, and you have to run the game on a mobile device, please follow these tips to make sure 
you won't encounter any problems during your event:

* Make sure the energy saving options are turned off / are sufficiently long. We have noticed that in some cases a 
device going in standby causes the game page to refresh, causing the game to finish.
* If you have audio- and video fragments in your quiz: make sure to test the quiz completely before your event starts. 
Some devices have trouble playing large video fragments.

Please do note that, even though these tips might help, we do not recommend using mobile devices to host important quizzes.
