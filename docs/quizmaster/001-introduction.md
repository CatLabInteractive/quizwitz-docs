# ðŸŽ¤ QuizWitz Live â€“ Introduction

## Hosting a quiz with QuizWitz Live

The first ingredient for a successful QuizWitz Live event is an engaging quizmaster â€” someone who controls the game and keeps the energy high. The quizmaster leads the flow of the quiz, reads the questions aloud, and adds that extra spark to entertain the audience.

To take full control of your event, use the **Quizmaster App**, designed specifically for QuizWitz Live.  
You can launch QuizWitz Live directly from the quiz editor by clicking **â€˜Start QuizWitz Liveâ€™**.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** The Quizmaster App is a **web app** â€” there's nothing to install. Simply go to [**quizwitz.tv**](https://quizwitz.tv) in your browser to access it on your smart device.

## ðŸ§° Requirements

To ensure a smooth and professional quiz experience, make sure you have:

- **A large screen or projector** showing the main game screen â€” or a **livestream** accessible to all players
- **A tablet or laptop** for the quizmaster to control the game and read the script aloud
- **A laptop or tablet** for the jury (if needed) to evaluate open answer questions
- **One smart device per player or team** (e.g. smartphone or tablet) to submit answers

> If your quiz includes **open answer questions**, youâ€™ll need a jury to review submissions. While the quizmaster can take on this role with an extra device, we recommend assigning one or more dedicated jury members so the quizmaster can focus on presenting.
