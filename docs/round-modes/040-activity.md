# 🎭 Activity

An Activity round lets you step away from standard quiz questions for a creative or physical challenge. The quizmaster describes an activity or duel, selects teams to compete, and awards points based on performance.

## 🏆 How it works

- **Challenge Description:** The round begins with a description of the activity (e.g., “Fold a paper plane and throw it as far as possible. Furthest wins!”).
- **Team/Player Selection:** The quizmaster selects which teams or players will participate in the activity.
  - **Random selection ensures every team is drawn an equal number of times throughout the quiz.**
- **Timer & Tools:** Start a timer and use sound effects (like buzzer or bells) to manage the challenge.
- **Award Points:** After the activity, the quizmaster enters the results and awards points to the winning team(s).
