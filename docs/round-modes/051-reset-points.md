# 🔄 Reset points

**Reset points** is a special event (not a question round) that sets the score of all players or teams back to zero.  
This can be used to level the playing field, add suspense, or introduce new phases in your quiz.

---

## 📝 How it works

- When triggered, the event **instantly sets the score of every player or team to 0**.
- This applies to all participants, regardless of previous ranking or performance.

---

> Use **Reset points** to create dramatic restarts, new game phases, or to give everyone a fair shot at a big final round!
