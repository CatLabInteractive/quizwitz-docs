# ⚡ Lightning round

The **Lightning round** is all about speed and excitement. Players answer a rapid series of questions with very short timers — all set to continuous timer music for maximum energy and tension.

---

## 📝 How it works

- Questions are presented one after another with minimal delay.
- Timer music plays **continuously** throughout the round, only stopping after the last question.
- Players must answer quickly; there’s no break between questions.
- **By default, feedback for each question is postponed until the end of the round,** but each question’s feedback is shown separately, not grouped on a single screen.
- If you want to group all feedback on one screen at the end, you can enable this in the round settings.

## ⚙️ Feedback settings

- **Default (postponed feedback):** Feedback for each question is shown after the last question, one by one in sequence.
- **Grouped feedback:** If “Show all question feedback at the end of the round” is enabled in round settings, all feedback is combined into a single feedback screen at the end.
- **Force results after question:** If enabled in a question’s settings, feedback for that question will always be shown immediately, regardless of round feedback grouping.

See [round options](../editor/008-round-options.md) for details on configuring feedback timing.

## 🎵 Attachments — Countdown music

- You can set a **Round Attachment** in the slot “Play during question countdown.”  
  This audio attachment will play **continuously** as the countdown music during the entire lightning round, only stopping after the last question.
- Use energetic or tense music to boost excitement and keep players on their toes.

For more details, see the [attachments documentation](../../editor/attachments.md).

## 🏆 Scoring

- **Time-based scoring is *not* recommended** for this round type.
- Instead, use a **short question timer** (typically 15 seconds).
- Set point values lower than usual (e.g. 500 points per question) to keep the game fair and minimize the impact of wrong answers.

For scoring setup, see the [scoring section](../editor/008-round-options.md#scoring).

## 💡 Tips

- **Keep questions short:** This encourages fast, instinctive answers.
- **Use energetic music:** Timer music adds to the pressure and excitement.
- **Balance difficulty:** Too many tough questions can stall the pace.
- **Lower the stakes:** Fewer points and shorter timers mean mistakes aren’t too punishing.
