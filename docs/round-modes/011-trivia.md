# ❓ Trivia (regular round)

The **Trivia** round is the classic, default round type in QuizWitz. It presents a series of questions to all players — ideal for general knowledge, themed quizzes, or warm-up rounds.

---

## 📝 How it works

- Supports a mix of question types (multiple choice, open questions, image map, etc).
- Players answer each question individually, following the round’s settings for feedback and scoring.
- Great for testing broad knowledge or mixing up topics.

---

## ⚙️ Recommended settings

- **Question feedback:** By default, players see feedback after every question. You can group feedback at the end of the round if you prefer (see [round options](../editor/008-round-options.md)).
- **Random question order:** Can be enabled for variety.
- **Timer:** Set per question, or adjust round defaults.

## 🏆 Scoring

- Each question uses its own scoring type (time-based, fixed, etc) as configured.
- For more about scoring and customization, see [round scoring settings](../editor/008-round-options.md#scoring).

## 💡 Tips

- **Mix question types:** Add variety for engagement.
- **Keep it balanced:** Alternate easy and tough questions to keep players motivated.
- **Use media:** Attach images, audio, or video for richer content.
