# 🧵 Common Thread

The **Common Thread** round is a special variation of the classic Trivia round. In this round, players answer a series of regular questions, but the twist is that all answers are secretly connected by a single underlying theme or link — the “common thread.”

---

## 📝 How it works

- Players answer a sequence of questions as usual.
- The final question in the round is typically **“What is the common thread that connects all these answers?”**
- Instead of showing feedback after each question, **all feedback is postponed until the end of the round.**
- When the round ends, feedback for the final “common thread” question is shown **first**.
- After that, feedback for all previous questions is revealed, allowing the quizmaster to explain how each answer ties into the overall theme.

## ⚙️ Feedback and scoring

- **Postponed feedback:** No immediate answer feedback after each question. Everything is revealed at the end.
- **Quizmaster control:** The feedback reveal sequence helps build suspense and encourages group discussion.
- **Scoring:** Each question uses its configured scoring type. The “common thread” question is usually open or freeform.

See [round options](../editor/008-round-options.md) for details on configuring feedback timing and scoring.

## 💡 Tips for writing a Common Thread round

- **Choose a good link:** Pick a theme that is clever but not impossible to guess.
- **Balance the questions:** Ensure each question makes sense on its own, but also fits the common thread.
- **Final question:** End the round with a clear, direct question asking players to identify the link.
