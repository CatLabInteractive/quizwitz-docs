# Frequently asked questions

## Why can I only play 7 questions?
You can only play 7 random questions in Round-Abouts. Round-Abouts are sets of questions about a specific subject 
(like, for example 'Shoes worn by historic figures' or 'Fruits starting with A'). They are meant to be published and 
shared with the community. Other players then include these Round-Abouts in their Collection. When they start a game 
from their collection, the game picks 5 Round-Abouts at random, picks 7 questions from each Round-About and 
users these to generate a random quiz.

If you want to create a custom quiz where all questions are shown in the order you have entered them, you need to 
create a Quiz. In Quizzes you get full control of the order of the rounds and questions, and nothing is randomized.

## Why are the questions asked in a random order?
You have likely created a Round-About. Round-Abouts are sets of questions about a specific subject and are meant to be 
published and shared with the community. Other users can then add these Round-Abouts to their collection and start 
quizzes with a randomized selection of questions in their collected Round-Abouts.

If you want to create a custom quiz where all questions are shown in the order you have entered them, you need to
create a Quiz. In Quizzes you get full control of the order of the rounds and questions, and nothing is randomized.

## How do I create a quiz?
To create a quiz, click the 'Create' button on top and then select 'Quiz'. Please note that Quizzes are only available 
for users with a  Premium license. Round-Abouts are free, but in those rounds you are not able to specify the order or 
the amount of questions.

If you want to first test out our software before buying a premium account, please check out our Shop and 
activate the 'Free example quiz'. This will add a demo quiz to your Collection that you will be able to edit to 
experience our software before buying it.

## Can I get a report of all players answers?
When using the QuizWitz PRO module you do get an email with a link to a Report that contains all answers that players 
have given. We do not provide a report for Conference of Party games.

## What is the difference between a Premium account and PRO games?
A premium account allows you to play the regular QuizWitz game with up to 1000 players. (100 in party mode or 1000 in 
conference mode). These modes should be sufficient for most use cases. We charge a yearly fee for Premium accounts.

Our QuizWitz PRO game modes are aimed towards professional quizmasters who want to take their games to an extra level. 
Instead of paying a periodic fee, PRO games are charged per player. For more information on pricing of PRO games, 
please visit our [QuizWitz PRO seats page](https://app.quizwitz.com/seats).

## Can players choose their own name?
Yes! In Party games, players can choose their name by registering a QuizWitz account on their own smartphone. They 
can then also change their profile picture that will appear in the game.

Don't want the hassle of one-time registration? Then select the 'Conference' mode (also available in QuizWitz PRO). 
Players will then first be asked to choose a name before joining the game and won't have to login or register.
