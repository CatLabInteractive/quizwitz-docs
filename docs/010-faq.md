# Frequently asked questions

## How do I join a game?
QuizWitz is a party game and is meant to be played with a bunch of people sitting in the same room or videostream call.
Therefor it is not possible to join a game that someone you don't know has started.

## Why can I only play 7 questions?
You can only play 7 random questions in Round-Abouts.  Round-Abouts are sets of questions about a specific subject 
(like, for example 'Shoes worn by historic figures' or 'Fruits starting with A'). They are meant to be published and 
shared with the community. Other players then include these Round-Abouts in their Collection. When they start a game 
from their collection, the game picks 5 Round-Abouts at random, picks 7 questions from each Round-About and 
users these to generate a random quiz.

If you want to create a custom quiz where all questions are shown in the order you have entered them, you need to 
create a Quiz. In Quizzes you get full control of the order of the rounds and questions, and nothing is randomized.

## I want to create a quiz with questions in a specific order
To create a quiz, click the 'Create' button on top and then select 'Quiz'. Please note that Quizzes are only available 
for users with a  Premium license. Round-Abouts are free, but in those rounds you are not able to specify the order or 
the amount of questions.

If you want to first test out our software before buying a premium account, please check out our Shop and 
activate the 'Free example quiz'. This will add a demo quiz to your Collection that you will be able to edit to 
experience our software before buying it.
