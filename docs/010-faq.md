# Frequently asked questions

---

## ❓ Why can I only play 7 questions?

You can only play 7 random questions in [Round-Abouts](editor/003-create-round-about.md). Round-Abouts are small sets of questions on a specific subject (for example: 'Shoes worn by historic figures' or 'Fruits starting with A').  
They are meant to be published and shared with the community. When you start a game from your collection, the game picks 5 Round-Abouts at random, selects 7 questions from each Round-About, and uses these to generate a random quiz.

If you want to create a custom quiz where all questions are shown in the exact order you’ve entered them, you need to create a [Quiz](editor/004-create-quizzes.md). In Quizzes, you get full control of the order of rounds and questions — nothing is randomized.

## 🔀 Why are the questions asked in a random order?

You have likely created a Round-About. Round-Abouts are meant to be played in random order to keep games fresh and replayable for the community.

If you want to control question order, create a [Quiz](editor/004-create-quizzes.md). Quizzes allow you to specify the exact sequence of rounds and questions.

## 📊 Can I get a report of all players’ answers?

If you use [QuizWitz Live](quizmaster/001-introduction.md) or any other PRO game, you’ll receive an email with a link to a detailed report containing all answers players gave.

Reports are **not** available for Conference or Party games.

---

## 💎 What’s the difference between a Premium account and PRO games?

- **Premium account** — Lets you play regular QuizWitz games with up to 1000 players (100 in party mode, or 1000 in conference mode).
- **PRO games** — For professional quizmasters, with extra features and controls. PRO games use a seat-based system and are charged per player.

For more info, see [Seats & Licenses](quizmaster/005-seats.md).

---

## 🧑‍🎤 Can players choose their own name?

Yes! In Party games, players can choose their name by registering a QuizWitz account on their smartphone. They can also change their profile picture.

Prefer not to require registration? Use **Conference mode** (available in PRO and Premium). Here, players pick a name before joining — no registration or login required.

---

## 🔑 How do I join a quiz?

To join a game, go to [quizwitz.tv](https://www.quizwitz.tv) and enter the code you see on the game screen.

**Tip:** You should be able to see the game screen (in person or on a livestream), otherwise you might miss important information.

---

## 🎉 How can I play with my friends?

QuizWitz is designed as a party game for groups — either in the same room or via a video call.  
You cannot join a random public game.

To play with friends:
1. Start a game on your device.
2. Share the code displayed on the main screen with your friends.
3. Everyone joins at [quizwitz.tv](https://www.quizwitz.tv) using that code.

---

## 🖥️ How can I make the game fullscreen?

There are two ways:

1. **Hover over the bottom of the game screen.** Click the square icon to enter fullscreen mode.
2. **Use Advanced Game Settings.** Generate a unique link for your quiz using advanced options, and open this link in any browser — this will launch the game in fullscreen.

---

## ⏸️ Is there a way to pause the quiz?

Yes!  
Move your mouse cursor to the bottom of the game screen — a **pause** button will appear.

**Note:** If the game screen loses focus (for example, you switch browser tabs), the game will also automatically pause for all players. To continue, return to the game tab and unpause using the button at the bottom (hover to reveal).

For even more control (pausing, skipping, etc.), use [QuizWitz Live](quizmaster/001-introduction.md) with the Quizmaster App.

---

## 👥 Can I host a tournament or a conference booth game?

Yes!
- For **tournament mode** (with a live leaderboard and anytime play), see the [Tournament guide](tutorials/060-tournament.md).
- For **conference booth games** (ideal for events and expos), see the [Conference Booth tutorial](tutorials/050-conference-booth.md).

---

## 🎨 Can I customize the look of the game?

Absolutely!  
The easiest way is to use the [Emerald theme](advanced/011-emerald-theme.md) and add your own attachments (backgrounds, logos, music).  
For full theming, see our [Theming guide](advanced/010-theming.md).

---

## 📱 Can I play or host games on my phone or tablet?

QuizWitz is optimized for computers, especially for hosting games. While you can join as a player on your phone or tablet, we **do not recommend** hosting full games on mobile devices.  
See [Mobile browsers](quizmaster/010-mobile-browsers.md) for tips if you must use a mobile device.

---

## 🆘 What if my game crashes or hangs?

QuizWitz automatically saves the game state in your browser. If the main game screen crashes or reloads unexpectedly, simply reopen the same game URL in the same browser — you’ll be prompted to resume your game or start over.  
For more details, see [Live Crash Recovery](099-game-recovery.md).
