# Frequently asked questions

## Why can I only play 7 questions?
You can only play 7 random questions in Round-Abouts. Round-Abouts are sets of questions about a specific subject (like, for example, "Shoes worn by historic figures" or "Fruits starting with A"). They are meant to be published and shared with the community. Other players then include these Round-Abouts in their Collection. When they start a game from their collection, the game picks 5 Round-Abouts at random, picks 7 questions from each Round-About, and uses these to generate a random quiz.

If you want to create a custom quiz where all questions are shown in the order you have entered them, you need to create a Quiz. In Quizzes you get full control of the order of the rounds and questions, and nothing is randomized.

## Why are the questions asked in a random order?
You have likely created a Round-About. Round-Abouts are sets of questions about a specific subject and are meant to be published and shared with the community. Other users can then add these Round-Abouts to their collection and start quizzes with a randomized selection of questions from their collected Round-Abouts.

If you want to create a custom quiz where all questions are shown in the order you have entered them, you need to create a Quiz. In Quizzes you get full control of the order of the rounds and questions, and nothing is randomized.

## How do I create a quiz?
To create a quiz, click the 'Create' button on top and then select 'Quiz'. Please note that Quizzes are only available for users with a **Premium license**. Round-Abouts are free, but in those rounds you are not able to specify the order or the amount of questions.

If you want to test out QuizWitz before buying a premium account, check out our Shop and activate the 'Free example quiz'. This will add a demo quiz to your Collection that you will be able to edit and try before you buy.

## Can I get a report of all players' answers?
When using the **QuizWitz Live** or **Conference** game modes (which require seats), you will receive an email with a link to a report containing all answers players have given. We do not provide a report for Party games.

## What is the difference between a Premium account, Party game, and Live/Conference games?
- **Premium account:**  
  Unlocks all quizmaker features (including creating and editing quizzes, advanced round options, attachments, and more). Premium also allows you to host **Party games** with up to 100 players.
- **Party game:**  
  The standard, social game mode. Great for friends, families, or small groups—up to 100 players. Included with a Premium account. No seats are required.
- **Live and Conference games:**  
  Designed for professional events, large audiences, and advanced control. Both **require active seats** for each player or team. Seats are not included in the Premium account and must be activated separately.
    - These modes unlock features like the Quizmaster app, Jury app, detailed reporting, and more.

For more on seat licensing, visit the [Seats documentation](quizmaster/005-seats.md).

## Can players choose their own name?
Yes!
- In Party games, players can choose their name by registering a QuizWitz account on their own smartphone (they can also change their profile picture).
- In Conference mode and Live games, players can choose a name before joining the game, with no registration required.

## Is there a way to pause the quiz?
Yes! Move your mouse cursor to the bottom of the screen. A 'pause' button will appear.

If you want more control, use the **QuizWitz Live** game mode with the Quizmaster App. This gives you full control over the pacing and flow of your quiz.
