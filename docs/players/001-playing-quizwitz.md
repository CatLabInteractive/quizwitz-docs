TIP: You can also play your own collection in one go. Just click 'My Collection' and then click the 'Play my collection' button. Enjoy!

Choose a Round-About to play
----------------------------
A Round-About is the smallest collection of questions. Itâ€™s one game round about a certain topic. 
If you want to know more about the Round-About, click on the image, the title or the comments icon as 
shown on the image with pointers.

Ready to play? Click one of the buttons marked by a square.

Collect Round-Abouts
--------------------
Playing a single Round-About isn't much fun: the game will only pick 7 random questions from the Round-About and then 
the game will be finished. It's much more fun to play a game with multiple rounds.

If you want to add a Round-About to your personal collection for safekeeping, you can click add to my collection in 
the Round-About settings. Alternatively, you can click the little start in the top right of the Round-About description.

You can also discard Round-Abouts from your Collection by clicking this same button. 
It will be named Remove from my collection at this time.

Just click My Collection in the main menu to manage and play all your quiz games.

Now that you have selected a bunch of interesting Round-Abouts, you are ready to play a random selection of them.

Select your game mode (Single player or Party game) and then select which Round-Abouts you want to include in your 
random game. The game will try to make sure to only ask questions that have not been asked before.
