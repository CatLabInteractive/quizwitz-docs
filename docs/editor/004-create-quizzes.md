# 🧠 Create a Full Quiz

Want to build a complete quiz experience for players or events? This guide walks you through creating a full quiz using multiple rounds — including your own questions or Round-Abouts you've collected.

---

## 🎬 Getting started

From the main menu:

1. Click **Create**
2. Choose **Quiz** from the dropdown

---

## ✏️ Title and language

Give your quiz a title and choose the main language.  
You can add **translations** later if needed — no need to decide everything upfront.

---

## ➕ Add rounds and questions

Click **Add new round** to begin building your quiz. Each round can include its own settings and structure.

On the left sidebar, you’ll be able to:

- Name the round
- Choose a category
- [Import questions](../editor/import-questions) in bulk

![Create new round in quiz](../../assets/images/quiz-add-round.png)

In the main editor, you can:

- Add and edit individual questions
- Reorder rounds or questions using the **arrow buttons**
- Delete rounds or questions using the **trash bin icon**

> 💡 Use the **Import questions** tool to quickly add multiple questions at once. Just follow the on-screen instructions and [check that everything imported correctly](../editor/import-questions).

---

## ⚙️ Round settings

Each round can have its own rules and format. Learn more in the advanced guides:

- [Round modes](../round-modes/round-modes) — Configure how a round behaves (e.g., lightning round, puzzle round)
- [Question modes](../question-modes/question-modes) — Adjust the format and scoring for each question

---

## 💾 Save and manage your quiz

Remember to:

- **Save** your quiz regularly
- **Test and play** at any time
- **Publish** your quiz when it’s ready to share

> 📢 To publish a quiz, it must contain **at least 14 questions**. Once published, it becomes available to the community — but you can unpublish it later if needed.

> 📝 **Publishing is entirely optional.** You can play any quiz or Round-About privately without publishing it. This is great for personal use, testing, or private events.

## ▶️ Testing & playing
