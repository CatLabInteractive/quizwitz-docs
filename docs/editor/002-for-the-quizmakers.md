# Quiz Makerâ€™s guide
Welcome to the guide for quiz creators. You can create Round-Abouts or Full Quizzes. 
You can also collect existing Round-Abouts.

TIP:  A Round-About is the smallest element in QuizWItz. It is a collection of questions in a specific category that 
are shown in random order. You can publish them on the platform for others to play.

A Full Quiz is a collection of rounds that can be tailored to your preference.
