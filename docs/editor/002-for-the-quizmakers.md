# 🛠️ Quizmaker’s guide

Welcome to the guide for quiz creators! On QuizWitz, you can build and organize your own quiz content — or collect and remix content created by others.

---

## 🧩 What you can create

As a quizmaker, you can work with:

- **Round-Abouts** — Small themed collections of questions shown in random order
- **Full Quizzes** — Custom quizzes made by combining multiple Round-Abouts into a single flow

You can also **collect Round-Abouts** created by others and include them in your own quizzes.

---

> 💡 **Tip:** A **Round-About** is the smallest building block in QuizWitz. It focuses on a specific topic and can be played or reused by other creators. You can publish them publicly or keep them private.

> A **Full Quiz** is a larger quiz experience composed of multiple rounds. You can define the order, rules, and structure to fit your needs.
