## 📝 Name & attribution

Each attachment can have a name and optional attribution:

- **Name** — Displayed to the quizmaster in [QuizWitz Live (PRO)](../quizmaster/introduction); helps in organizing attachments
- **Attribution** — Shown to players as credit or source information. This should be the **name of the rights holder**.

> ⚠️ In order to **publish** a Round-About or Quiz, **all attachments must have a valid attribution** filled in. Without this, your entry cannot be made public.

## ✨ Attachment effects

Some attachment slots support **effects** to reveal visuals more gradually:

- **None** — The file is shown as-is
- **Spotlight effect** — Gradually reveals parts of the image over time with a moving spotlight that expands as it progresses

This is especially effective for puzzles or slow reveals during intros or dramatic moments.

## 📚 Multiple attachments per slot

Some slots allow adding **multiple attachments**. The way these behave depends on the game mode:

> ⚡ **In [QuizWitz Live (PRO)](../quizmaster/introduction):** The quizmaster has full control and can decide when to show or hide attachments during gameplay.  
> 🎮 **In regular games:** All attachments within a slot are shown **simultaneously**.

Details about each slot’s timing and behavior can be found in the linked documentation for [questions](../editor/writing-questions), [rounds](../editor/round-options), and [quizzes](../editor/quiz-options).
