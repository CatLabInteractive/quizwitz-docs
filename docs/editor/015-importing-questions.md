# 📥 Import questions

There are two ways to quickly add questions to a round in QuizWitz:

- Import existing content from the **QuizWitz Library**
- Paste a list of questions from a **spreadsheet**

Both options are accessible from within any round.

### 🗂️ Format for pasting

Each row must contain the following columns in this exact order:

1. **Short question** — Displayed on the player screen
2. **Correct answer**
3. **Wrong answer 1** (leave blank for open questions)
4. **Wrong answer 2**
5. **Wrong answer 3**
6. **Short feedback** — Displayed on the player screen after answering
7. **Long question** *(optional)* — Displayed on the quizmaster screen
8. **Long feedback** *(optional)* — Explanation for the quizmaster to read aloud

> 📌 The last two columns are only used in [QuizWitz Live](../quizmaster/001-introduction.md), but they must still be included (even if left empty).
