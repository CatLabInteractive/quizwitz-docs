## ⚙️ General round options

The following options are available for most round types:

- **Only show _X_ questions** — Limits the round to a specific number of questions
- **Random question order** — Shuffle the question order within the round
- **Show round intro** — Display an animated title before the round begins
- **Show round outro (interim score)** — Reveal rankings at the end of the round
- **Group all feedback in a single screen** — Collect question feedback in one block after the round ends
- **Show all question feedback at the end of the round** — Delay question feedback until the round ends
- **Force feedback after each individual question** — Ensure immediate feedback
  > ⚠️ This only takes effect in round and question types where feedback would otherwise be delayed, such as open questions or lightning rounds.

📘 See [question modes](../advanced/question-modes/question-modes) for more information on feedback timing and behavior.
