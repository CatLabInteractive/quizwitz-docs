📘 For a detailed overview of all round types, visit the [round types documentation](../round-types/000-round-types.md).

## ⚙️ General round options

The following options are available for most round types:

- **Only show _X_ questions** — Limits the round to a specific number of questions
- **Random question order** — Shuffle the question order within the round
- **Show round intro** — Display an animated title before the round begins
- **Show round outro (interim score)** — Reveal rankings at the end of the round
- **Group all feedback in a single screen** — Collect question feedback in one block after the round ends
- **Show all question feedback at the end of the round** — Delay question feedback until the round ends
- **Force feedback after each individual question** — Ensure immediate feedback
  > ⚠️ This only takes effect in round and question types where feedback would otherwise be delayed, such as open questions or lightning rounds.

📘 See [question types](../question-types/000-question-types.md) for more information on feedback timing and behavior.

## 🏆 Scoring options {#scoring}

QuizWitz offers flexible scoring to keep things fair and engaging for all players.

- **Time-based scoring** — Players earn more points for faster answers.
  - For most question types, time-based points decrease **continuously per microsecond**: the faster you answer, the more points you score.
  - For **open questions**, time-based points are divided into blocks. For example: answers in the first block (e.g., first few seconds) earn **100%** of the time-based portion, the next block earns **80%**, and so on. This helps level the playing field for slower typers.

- **Fixed percentage of points on time-based scoring** — You control how much of the total score is influenced by speed.
  - By default, **75%** of the points are fixed (everyone who answers correctly gets these points, regardless of speed).
  - Only the remaining **25%** is influenced by how quickly players respond.

> 💡 Adjusting this setting lets you make rounds more knowledge-based or more speed-based, depending on your quiz style.

These scoring options can be found in the round options panel when editing a round.

## 📜 Quizmaster instructions

You can add a custom **round introduction text** that will appear only on the [Quizmaster app](../quizmaster/001-introduction.md) at the start of the round. Use this to brief the presenter or add a personal touch.
