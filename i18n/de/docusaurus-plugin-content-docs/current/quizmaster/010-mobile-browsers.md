## ⚠️ If you must use a mobile device...

If using a phone or tablet is your only option, follow these steps to minimize the risk of technical issues:

### 🔋 Disable power-saving features

- Make sure **energy-saving modes are turned off**
- Increase your device’s **auto-sleep timeout**
- Some mobile browsers may **refresh the page when the device sleeps**, which can end the game unexpectedly

### 🎞️ Test audio and video fragments

- If your quiz includes **audio or video**, test it in advance
- Some devices may **struggle with large media files** or not play them at all
- Be especially cautious with **older devices** or default mobile browsers

## 🚫 Not recommended for live events

Even with the precautions above, we strongly advise **against** using mobile devices to host important or high-stakes events.

For the best performance and stability:

- Use a **modern desktop or laptop computer**
- Run your game in **Chrome, Firefox**, or **Edge**
- Avoid using Safari on iOS for anything other than playing

For hosting, a reliable setup is key — mobile devices should be used only as a last resort.
