# 🧑‍⚖️ Jury app — Reviewing open answers in QuizWitz Live

If your quiz includes **open answer questions**, you'll need to use the **Jury app** to manually review and score responses.

---

## 🗂️ Using the Jury app

The Jury app is a separate interface used by jury members to evaluate answers and manage scoring.

To open the Jury app:

1. At the start of the quiz, a **Jury Code** is generated.
2. On a separate device, go to [**catlab.tv**](https://catlab.tv)
3. Enter the **Jury Code** to access the app

> 💡 You can open the Jury app on any browser — it's a web app, no installation required.

Once inside, the Jury app provides several useful tools:

- **Judge questions** — Open question results will appear once a question is completed.
  - The game does **not wait** for the jury to finish — unless it’s the **last question of the round** or the quiz settings say otherwise.
  - Once judged, results appear **after the next question**.

- **Edit scores** — Grant or revoke points manually per player or team.

- **Game control** — Adjust question timers or add streaming delays if needed.
  > Für die Einrichtung der Livestream-Verzögerung siehe [**wie man ein QuizWitz Live Quiz auf Twitch veranstaltet**](../tutorials/040-livestreaming.md)

- **Report** — Generate a full game report with results and player answers.

## ✅ Judging open questions

After each open question, the Jury app displays all submitted answers. Jury members must:

1. Review each answer carefully
2. Tick the checkbox next to each **acceptable** answer
3. Click **‘Confirm’** to lock in the results

QuizWitz will **automatically detect exact matches** and mark them as correct. Jury members are responsible for reviewing:

- Partial or alternate answers
- Phonetic matches
- Common spelling variations

> 🎙️ QuizWitz was designed with phonetic matching in mind — but the final decision is always up to the judges.

With the Jury app, you can fairly assess open responses, adjust scores, and ensure a balanced quiz experience for all players.
