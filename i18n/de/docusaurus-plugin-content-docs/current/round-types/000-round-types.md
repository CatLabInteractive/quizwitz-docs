# Round types

The round type influences the way the game shows the questions to the players — and how players earn points.\
In quizzes, you can change the round type in the **Round type** select field at the top middle of the screen.

## 🧠 Regular rounds

- [Trivia](011-trivia.md) (default)
- [Common Thread](012-common-thread.md)
- [Lightning Round](013-lightning-round.md)

## 🤹 Interactive rounds

These rounds offer a bit more interactivity than simple ask-and-answer questions.

- [Piece of pie](021-piece-of-pie.md)
- [Multiquestion](022-multiquestion.md)
- [Strike](023-strike.md)
- [Dealer's choice](024-dealers-choice.md)

## 🍺 Traditional

For anyone who wants to organize traditional pub quizzes where players can change their answers until the end of the round.\
These round types simulate "handing in the papers" after each round.

- [Traditional](030-traditional.md)
- [Traditional — Common thread](031-traditional-ct.md)

## 🎉 Live events

- [Intermission](060-intermission.md)
