# 🎛️ Using the Quizmaster app

As the quizmaster, you are in full control of the QuizWitz Live game. The most important thing to know is this:

> The game **only progresses when you click** — nothing moves on the main screen until you tell it to.

This gives you full control over pacing and timing, but it also means you’ll be doing a lot of tapping. Let’s walk through how the app works.

## 🔁 The quiz flow

The quiz structure follows how it was built in the editor, but most quizzes will move through the following stages:

---

### 🎬 Round introduction

Before each round starts, you’ll see a round introduction screen.

- You control when the **round intro animation** plays.
- Click **‘Start’** to begin the round and move to the first question.

---

### ❓ Asking a question

Each question has its own screen in the Quizmaster app:

![Quizmaster app - start question](/images/quizmaster-app-start-question.png)

You’ll see:

- **Question number** — e.g. `1.1` means the first question of the first round
- **Question type** — such as Multiple Choice, with relevant scoring modifiers
- **Long version of the question** — for you to read out loud
- **Question info** — including timer duration and available points
- **Short question** — the version shown on the big screen
- **Start question button** — immediately starts the timer
- **Possible answers** — displayed in the correct order (for multiple choice)

The question will remain visible in your app until either:

- All players have answered
- The timer runs out

> 🔎 For more on question and round types, check the **Quizmaker's Guide**.

### ✅ Question feedback

After a question ends, the correct answer is revealed. What you see depends on the question type — this example shows a multiple choice result screen:

Includes:

- **Question number**
- **Short question text**
- **Correct answer**
- **Answer spread** — in numbers and percentages
- **Long feedback** — extra info to read aloud
- **Continue button** — advances to the next question
- **Fastest 100 answers** — shown at the bottom of the screen

### 📊 Round outro

When a round finishes, you’ll see a **Round Outro** screen that reveals the standings so far.

In your app:

- You’ll see the **top 100 players**, and you can scroll through them
- Tap a player’s position to highlight them on the big screen
- From round 2 onward, you’ll also see how many places each player has moved:
    - **Green** = moved up
    - **Red** = moved down
    - **White** = no change

Players will see **their own position** on their device during the outro.

---

### 🏆 The end of the quiz

At the end of the quiz, it’s time for a **winner reveal party** — complete with confetti and player emojis flying across the screen.

- The default setting shows the **top 12 players**
- You can customize how many players appear in the **advanced game settings**

> 🎉 Fun tip: The emoji your players choose will dance around the screen — even if they picked the smiling turd.
