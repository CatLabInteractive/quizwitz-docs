# 🃏 Dealer's choice

The **Dealers’ Choice** round in QuizWitz adds a strategic twist to your quiz.
One of the players gets to **choose the next question category**, giving them a potential
edge—and possibly a bonus! Here's how to set it up and play:

---

## 🔧 How It Works

In this round, **one player becomes the "dealer"** and selects the next category to play. The method of selection depends on the game mode:

- **Party/Conference Game:** The dealer chooses a category using **their own device**.
- **Live Game:** The dealer **announces their choice aloud** to the quizmaster.

---

## 🏷️ Assigning Categories to Questions

Each question in the Dealers’ Choice round needs a **unique label**, which acts as the category the dealer sees and selects from.

For example:

- `Animals – Easy`
- `Animals – Hard`
- `History – Fun Facts`
- `Movies – Action Classics`

> Even if questions share a general theme, their labels should still be unique so players can clearly identify and choose them.

Labels are set in the **“Label” field** of each question's settings.

---

## 🏆 Dealer Bonus

If the dealer correctly answers the question they chose, they can receive a **bonus**:

- Configure the **bonus percentage** (e.g. 50%) in the **Dealer Bonus** setting.

> The bonus only applies if the dealer’s answer is correct.

---

## 👑 Dealer Selection

Before the round starts, QuizWitz determines the dealer using one of these options:

- Highest ranked player goes first
- Lowest ranked player goes first
- At random - Dealer is chosen randomly

> Rankings are locked in **at the beginning of the round**.

---

### Scoring Options:

- **Scoring strategy:** Choose _Dealer Bonus_
- **Time-based scoring:** Set the minimum percentage of points retained for slower answers (e.g. 75%)

## 📝 Tips for Quizmasters

- Let players know they’ll be choosing from labeled categories.
- In live games, be sure to note the dealer’s selection clearly.
- Use unique, descriptive labels to avoid confusion during selection.
