## 📝 How it works

- When triggered, the elimination event evaluates player rankings and **kicks out players or teams** according to your chosen rule.
- Elimination is not a round type with questions, but an automatic filter between rounds.

## ⚙️ Elimination criteria

You can configure the elimination event to:

- **Kick lowest ranked players** until a specified number of players remain
- **Kick highest ranked players** until a specified number of players remain
- **Kick lowest ranked** (a set number of) players
- **Kick highest ranked** (a set number of) players

The number of players to keep (or kick) can be set as an exact number or as a percentage of all participants.
