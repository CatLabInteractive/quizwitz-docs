# 🏁 Tiebreaker question

The Tiebreaker question is used to resolve ties at the end of a quiz.  
Players are asked to guess a number (for example, “How many beans are in the jar?”). The player whose answer is closest to the correct value will win in case of a tie.

## 📝 How it works

- **No points awarded:** The tiebreaker question does not award regular points.
- **Shadow points:** Instead, it uses “shadow points” that are only considered when two or more players have the same total score.
- **Closest wins:** The player with the answer closest to the correct value gets the higher position in the event of a tie.

## 💡 Tips for tiebreaker questions

- **Ask for an obscure number:** Choose a question where the answer is not widely known and is unlikely to be guessed exactly.
- **Encourage unique guesses:** Make sure the question has a wide possible range, so every player is likely to enter a different answer.
- **Use only for ties:** Shadow points are only used as a tiebreaker and will not affect the main game ranking.
