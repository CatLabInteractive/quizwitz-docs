# Tournament

This tutorial will show you how to use QuizWitz Tournament mode. Tournament mode lets players join and play your quiz whenever they want — on their own device. Their scores are recorded on a global leaderboard that you can display in your venue.

## 📝 Create the quiz

When building a tournament quiz, keep it short and engaging. If visitors need to spend too much time on the quiz, they might not finish.  
**Only players who finish the whole quiz will be listed on the leaderboard.**

### 🎲 Random question selection

Make the game select a random set of questions from your pool, so every playthrough feels unique — and returning players get different questions.

**Setup example:**

- Choose **Quiz** in the Create menu and name your quiz. Set the correct language.
- Create 3 rounds, naming them (e.g. Round 1, Round 2, Round 3).
- In each **Round settings** (cog icon), enable **Only show x questions** and set it to 5.
- Enable **Random question order** so the game doesn't always pick the same questions first.

Repeat these steps for every round in the quiz.

You will now receive two links:
