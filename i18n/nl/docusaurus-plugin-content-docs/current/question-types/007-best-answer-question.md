# 🎖️ Best answer question

In the **Best answer question** type, players write their own answers to an open-ended question.\
Points are awarded either manually by the quizmaster, or—if there is no quizmaster—by having players vote for their favorite response.

---

## 📝 How it works

- **Players answer:** Each player types their response to the open question.
- **Scoring:**
    - In **QuizWitz Live** (with a quizmaster), the host reviews all answers and assigns points to the best one(s).
    - In regular games (no host), players vote for the answer they think is best. The answer(s) with the most votes get the points.

## 💡 Tips for best answer questions

- Use creative, open-ended questions that invite original or funny responses.
- For in-person or hosted quizzes, the quizmaster can award points for creativity, accuracy, or humor.
- In self-hosted games, voting encourages players to read each other's answers and adds a fun social element.
