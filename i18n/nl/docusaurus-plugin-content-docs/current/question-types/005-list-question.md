# 📝 List question

A **List question** asks players to provide several correct answers from a larger list — perfect for prompts like “List the first 5 presidents of the United States of America” or “Name three elements in the periodic table.”

## 📝 How it works

- **Question:** Clearly state what you want players to list.
- **List items:** Enter all possible correct answers.
  - Mark some as **‘Given’** to show as examples on screen; these do NOT need to be answered.
  - Order does **not** matter — players can enter correct answers in any order.
- **Player input:** Players must provide a set number of answers (e.g., between 1 and 5). Points are awarded for each correct answer they submit.
- **Attachments:** Add images, audio, or video for context. Fill in attribution if publishing.

---

## ⚙️ Expanded settings

- **Minimum and maximum answers:** Define how many answers a player must give.
- **Points per answer:** Points can be awarded for each correct answer, or only when the minimum number is met.
- **Given options:** Use as in-question examples.
- **Correction:**
  - **Force automatic correction:** When enabled, QuizWitz automatically checks all answers (accepting small typos and variations). No jury needed.
  - **Manual review:** When not enabled, each provided answer must be reviewed by the [jury app](../quizmaster/004-jury-app.md).

## 🏆 Scoring

- **Points per correct answer:** Players earn points for each correct answer.
- **Time-based scoring** (if enabled):\
  Follows the **open question rules** for fairness:
  - The available points are split into blocks of time (not by the millisecond).\
    The available points are split into blocks of time (not by the millisecond).\
    For example: full points in the first block, 80% in the next, and so on.
  - **Only 25%** of the points depend on speed.\
    **Only 25%** of the points depend on speed.\
    The other **75%** is fixed — so even slower typers get most of the points if they answer correctly.
  - This reduces the penalty for typing speed and makes scoring fairer for everyone.
