# üîÄ Order question

In an **Order question**, players must put up to 4 items in the correct sequence.\
This round type is great for chronological, ranking, or sequencing challenges.

## üìù How it works

- **Question:** Clearly ask what order is required.\
  _(Example: ‚ÄúSelect the animals in the correct order from least to most legs.‚Äù)_
- **Options:** Enter up to four items. You define the correct sequence.
- **Player view:** Options are shown in random order. Players **select each item one by one** in the order they think is correct.
- **Feedback:** After answering, players see the correct order and (optionally) any extra explanation you provide.

## üèÜ Scoring

Order questions use **time-based scoring** by default:\
Faster correct answers earn more points, but most of the points are fixed. Time only affects a portion of the score.\
You can also turn off time-based scoring per question for fixed points only.

See [Scoring options in round settings](../editor/008-round-options.md#-scoring-options) for details.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Expanded settings

Order questions offer flexible settings:

- **Time limit:** Set how long players have to answer.
- **Points:** Set how many points are awarded for a fully correct answer.

See [writing questions](../editor/005-writing-questions.md) for more.

## üí° Tips for great order questions

- **Be specific:** State clearly how you want items ordered (e.g., least to most, oldest to newest).
- **Choose distinct options:** Avoid items that are too similar or ambiguous.
- **Explain the answer:** Use feedback to clarify the correct order after the question.
- **Mix formats:** Try chronological, size-based, or ranking-based questions for variety.
