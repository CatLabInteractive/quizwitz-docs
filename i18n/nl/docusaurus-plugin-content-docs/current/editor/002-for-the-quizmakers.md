# 🛠️ Quizmaker’s guide

Welcome to the guide for quiz creators!\
On QuizWitz, you can build and organize your own quiz content — or collect and remix content made by others.

---

## 🧩 What can you create?

As a quizmaker, you can work with:

- **Round-Abouts** — Small, themed collections of questions shown in random order
- **Full Quizzes** — Custom quizzes, combining multiple Round-Abouts in a specific sequence

You can also **collect Round-Abouts** created by other members and include them in your own quizzes.

---

> 💡 **Tip:**\
> A **Round-About** is the smallest building block in QuizWitz. It’s a short set of questions about a specific topic.\
> Round-Abouts can be published for others to use, or kept private just for you.
>
> A **Full Quiz** lets you combine multiple rounds, set the order, and define your own quiz flow and rules. Perfect for events or larger quiz experiences!

## 💎 Premium license

To create and publish **Full Quizzes**, you’ll need a [Premium license](https://www.quizwitz.com/pricing).\
This unlocks the ability to combine Round-Abouts, set custom order, and use advanced features.

Round-Abouts can always be created and shared for free!
