# Tournament

This tutorial will show you how to use QuizWitz Tournament mode. Tournament mode lets players join and play your quiz whenever they want — on their own device. Their scores are recorded on a global leaderboard that you can display in your venue.

## 📝 Create the quiz

When building a tournament quiz, keep it short and engaging. If visitors need to spend too much time on the quiz, they might not finish.\
If visitors need to spend too much time on the quiz, they might not finish.\
**Only players who finish the whole quiz will be listed on the leaderboard.**

### 🎲 Random question selection

Make the game select a random set of questions from your pool, so every playthrough feels unique — and returning players get different questions.

**Setup example:**

- Choose **Quiz** in the Create menu and name your quiz. Set the correct language.
- Create 3 rounds, naming them (e.g. Round 1, Round 2, Round 3).
- In each **Round settings** (cog icon), enable **Only show x questions** and set it to 5.
- Enable **Random question order** so the game doesn't always pick the same questions first.

Repeat these steps for every round in the quiz.
