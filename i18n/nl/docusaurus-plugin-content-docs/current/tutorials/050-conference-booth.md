## 📝 Creating the quiz

When building a quiz for a conference booth, keep in mind that some players may stick around for multiple games.\
To keep things fresh, make sure you have plenty of questions — enough to randomize and make each playthrough unique.

**Recommended setup:**

- 15 questions split into 3 rounds
- Create at least 3× that many questions for variety — more is better!

### 🎲 Step-by-step quiz creation

1. **Choose “Quiz”** in the Create menu and give your quiz a name. Set the correct language.
2. **Add 3 rounds** and name them (for example: Round 1, Round 2, Round 3).
3. In the **Round settings** (cog icon), enable **“Only show x questions”** and set the number to 5.\
  Also enable **“Random question order”** — otherwise the game will always pick the first 5 questions.\
  Repeat for each round.

4. **Add questions to each round.**\
  You can [write questions](/docs/editor/writing-questions) or use the Import button to quickly add content from Excel.

:::tip
Use lots of images and video clips — they make the game much more entertaining!

### 🔀 How random selection works

Each time the quiz runs, QuizWitz will select 5 random questions from each round. The system will distribute questions fairly so repeats are minimized.

## 🚀 Launch the quiz

The fastest way to launch your conference quiz:

1. Click **Play quiz**.
2. Select **Start Conference Mode**.

In this mode, players use their phones to connect to the game link on the main screen.\
When everyone is ready, the booth host presses Enter — and the game runs automatically.\
After the game ends, pressing Enter brings you right back to the connection screen for the next group.

## ⚙️ Advanced game options

Want more control?\
Choose **Advanced game options** and select **Conference mode** in the mode selector.\
You’ll get a unique link with all your chosen options.

- **Ask players’ email:**\
  Collect visitor emails for your booth! If you enable this, be sure to also set your **Privacy Policy URL**.
- When launching a game via the advanced options link, you may be prompted to log in before starting — this checks your content and licenses.
