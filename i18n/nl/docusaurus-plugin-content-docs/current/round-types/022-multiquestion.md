# ❓ Multiquestion

The **Multiquestion** round gives players (or teams) the freedom to pick which question they want to answer from a set of possibilities. This makes each playthrough unique and allows for strategic choices!

---

## 📝 How it works

- For each "question group," several alternative questions are presented.
- **Each player (or team) selects one question** from the available options to answer.
- Every question can have its own point value, difficulty, or type (multiple choice, open, etc.).
- Players only answer the question they picked; the rest are skipped for them.

---

## 🛠️ Editor setup

- In the quiz editor, create **Question groups**. Each group contains all the alternative questions for that turn.
- For each question in the group, set the **Label** field. This label is shown to players as the “title” or hint for their choice.
  - Labels can be cryptic (“A, B, C”), themed (“Animals”, “History”), or descriptive (“Easy MC”, “Hard open”).
- You can mix and match question types and point values within the same group.
- **Duration:** Even though you can set a different timer multiplier per question, the game uses the highest value for all questions in the group (so nobody is rushed).
- **Attachments:**
  - _Before question_ attachments from all options are combined into one view before players make their choice.
  - _During question_ visible attachments are not shown, but audio still plays.

## 💡 Tips

- Offer a mix of easy and hard questions for more strategy.
- Use labels creatively—mystery or fun themes can boost engagement.
- Reward risk-takers with higher point questions.
