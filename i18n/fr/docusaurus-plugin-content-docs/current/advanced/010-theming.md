# Theming

:::warning
While creating your own QuizWitz theme offers the most flexibility, it is a complex and time-consuming process. Dans la plupart des cas, il vaut beaucoup mieux personnaliser notre [th√®me Emerald](011-emerald-theme.md), qui a √©t√© sp√©cialement con√ßu pour √™tre facile √† adapter.
:::

QuizWitz themes are created using **Adobe Animate**. You can download a [theme template](https://themes.quizwitz.com/empty/quizwitz-empty-theme.zip) to use as a starting point. Be aware that theming QuizWitz is painstaking work and is best left to experienced designers who know the ins and outs of Adobe Animate.

Prefer to leave it to the professionals? Send us an email at [support@catlab.be](mailto:support@catlab.be) and we can provide an estimate to turn your design into a ready-to-use QuizWitz theme.

## üß™ Theme test tool

When you're ready to test your theme, **zip the contents of your design folder** ( ‚Äî not the folder itself; when you open the zip, you should see your files, not just a single folder ‚Äî ) and upload it to our [theme tester](https://themes.quizwitz.com/). This gives you a live preview of how your theme will look in the game.

After testing, email the zip file to us and we'll link it to your account so you can select and use your theme in your quizzes.
