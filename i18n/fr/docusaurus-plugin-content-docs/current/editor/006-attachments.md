Each attachment can have a name and optional attribution:

- **Nom** — Affiché au quizmaster dans [QuizWitz Live (PRO)](../quizmaster/001-introduction.md) ; aide à organiser les pièces jointes
- **Attribution** — Shown to players as credit or source information. This should be the **name of the rights holder**.

## ✨ Attachment effects

Some attachment slots support **effects** to reveal visuals more gradually:

- **None** — The file is shown as-is
- **Spotlight effect** — Gradually reveals parts of the image over time with a moving spotlight that expands as it progresses

This is especially effective for puzzles or slow reveals during intros or dramatic moments.

## 📚 Multiple attachments per slot

Some slots allow adding **multiple attachments**. The way these behave depends on the game mode:

> ⚡ **Dans [QuizWitz Live (PRO)](../quizmaster/001-introduction.md) :** Le quizmaster a le contrôle total et peut décider quand afficher ou cacher les pièces jointes pendant le jeu.\
> 🎮 **In regular games:** All attachments within a slot are shown **simultaneously**.

Les détails sur le timing et le comportement de chaque créneau se trouvent dans la documentation liée pour les [questions](../editor/015-importing-questions.md), les [rounds](../editor/008-round-options.md) et les [quizzes](../editor/007-quiz-options.md).
