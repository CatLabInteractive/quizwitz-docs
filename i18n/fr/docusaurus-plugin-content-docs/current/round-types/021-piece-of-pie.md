# 🥧 Piece of pie

In a **Piece of pie** round, teamwork pays off! The total points available for each question depend on the number of players, and are then split between all players (or teams) who answer the question correctly.

---

## 📝 How it works

- **Total points = base points × number of players (or teams).**
    - Example: If a question is worth 100 points and there are 20 players, 2,000 points are at stake.
- After the question, the **total points are divided equally** among everyone who answered correctly.
    - Example: If 5 players answered correctly, each of them gets 400 points.
- If everyone gets it right, everyone gets the same (lower) share. If only one player is correct, they get the whole “pie”!

## ⚙️ Time-based scoring

- **Time-based scoring can be enabled** (and is enabled by default).
- In that case, the displayed points are the _maximum_ you could win for a fast and correct answer.
- Your share of the “pie” will be adjusted for your speed _and_ the number of other correct answers.
- For details, see the [scoring section](../editor/008-round-options.md#scoring).

## 💡 Tips

- **Encourage unique knowledge!** The fewer people who get it right, the bigger the reward.
- **Speed still matters** if time-based scoring is on, but sharing the “pie” means you want to be both fast and correct.
- Works well for questions where there’s a single clear answer, or to reward players who think outside the box.
